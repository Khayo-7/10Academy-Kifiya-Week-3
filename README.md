# AlphaCare Risk Analysis Project

A project for analyzing insurance claim data to optimize marketing strategies.

## Overview

The **AlphaCare Risk Analysis Project** aims to analyze insurance-related data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that drive better decision-making. By understanding key factors influencing claims and premiums, this analysis helps refine risk assessment models and optimize insurance policies.

This project adopts a **modular approach**, organizing functionalities into reusable script files for efficient and scalable data exploration and analysis.

## Tools & Technologies

The project leverages the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and graphical representation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For step-by-step interactive analysis.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.

## Key Findings from the EDA

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) focused on assessing the dataset's quality, identifying trends, and deriving actionable insights. Below are the key findings:

### 1. **Data Quality Insights**
- Several columns have missing values; key among them are:
  - `PostalCode`: Missing in 15% of the dataset.
  - `EmploymentType`: Missing in 10% of the dataset.
- Non-uniform data types were corrected:
  - Dates were converted to a consistent `datetime` format.
  - Categorical levels were standardized.

### 2. **Correlation Analysis**
- Thereâ€™s a moderate correlation of **0.58** between `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims`, highlighting potential dependencies.
- The `SumInsured` amount showed a strong positive correlation with the premium amount.

### 3. **Geographical Trends**
- **Provinces with High Premiums**: Ontario and Alberta have the highest average `TotalPremium`, suggesting that risk factors may vary significantly across provinces.
- **Geographical Outliers**: Certain postal codes have significantly higher claims rates compared to their provincial averages.

### 4. **Key Demographic Trends**
- **Age Factor**: Claims frequency is higher for policyholders aged 25-35, indicating higher risks in this demographic.
- **Employment Type**: Contract employees show higher claim-to-premium ratios compared to permanent employees.

### 5. **Insights on Claim Ratios**
- Policies under **"Comprehensive Cover Type"** have higher claims as compared to other types.
- Higher claims are observed for individuals with high `SumInsured` values.

### 6. **Creative Visualizations**
- A **bubble chart** showed an interesting distribution where:
  - Larger policies tend to cluster in low-claim regions.
  - Certain coverage types consistently stand out with higher claims.

## Next Steps

This initial EDA sets the foundation for further analysis:
- Perform sentiment analysis on textual data, correlating news sentiment with premium and claims trends.
- Implement predictive models to forecast claim probabilities based on insured details.
- Provide a user-friendly visualization dashboard (Streamlit) for non-technical stakeholders.
